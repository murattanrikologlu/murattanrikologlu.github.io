<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the Ai Video Generator - Cinora app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Murat Tanrikologlu (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p><br>

<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>

<p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
  <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages</li>
  <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
  <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

<div style="display: none;">
<p>The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location and make use of in below ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Geolocation Services</li>
  <li>Analytics and Improvements</li>
  <li>Third-Party Services</li>
</ul>

<strong>Face Data & AI Processing</strong>

<p>When using AI Photo Editor’s AI filters, AI templates, or AI-generated portrait/headshot features, the photos you upload are temporarily processed only to detect basic facial key points (such as the approximate positions of the eyes, nose, and mouth). This detection is used solely to correctly apply the selected AI effect or style to your image.</p>
<p>The Application does not collect, store, or retain any biometric identifiers, facial geometry, or any face data that could be used to identify a person. Facial key point detection is performed automatically for visual processing only and is not linked to your identity, device information, or account.</p>
<p>All uploaded photos and their associated temporary facial key point data are stored securely on our servers only for processing purposes and are automatically deleted within 7 days. No images or facial data are permanently stored, shared with third parties, sold, or used for any purpose other than generating the requested AI effect.</p><br>
